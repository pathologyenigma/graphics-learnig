I've been learning graphics those days.
And I found ray tracing in one weekend.
I don't have the whole weekend, so I just read it whenever I have freetime.
the examples just the main function codes in every chapter.
I use git to store every chapter's code once.
just like a homework for ray tracing in one weekend.
